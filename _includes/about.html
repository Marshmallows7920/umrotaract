              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>We are based at the University of Manitoba location. The club was founded with the intention of bringing together like minded individuals to make an impact to improve local communities and make an impact to better the world. The group is growing at a steady pace with ages open to everyone. Our sponsor group is the Fort Garry Rotary club. We are here to address the physical and social needs of club members, local communities, and global communities.</p>
                <p>As most of the members are university students, we understand that there are many other commitments fellow members have, and are very flexible to upcoming circumstances. Every faculty is welcome, and we have a diverse group of individuals to assist with any questions. Ultimately we are here to foster support and warmth in our group.</p>
